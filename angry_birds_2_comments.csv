US,The creators chose to create hundreds of levels and the poor quality of the levels is evident. It would've been better if they focused on creating fun and interesting levels rather than just pack in as many as they could. Also the physics can be ridiculous.

That's when I noticed the tutorial vid only shows a 4 stage level, now it's 5. An added middle stage set up to waste at least 2 birds and make it harder to finish without buying special cards or lives.

US,"Rovio has succeeded in doing a masterful job of  ...using every crappy freemium gimmick to milk this franchise beyond the point where its fun any more.  The timed lives are pathetic. A game that actually PREVENTS you from playing it too much. Genius! As if the 5 lives was not bad enough, then they changed the max lives you could accumulate to 3! Its almost not even worth waiting for the app to open now.  The random levels and materials are the same reason I stopped playing  angrybirds Stella: Theres no point to winning since its mostly just the luck of the draw on what structures, pig locations, materials, and cards you happen to get.  Which also makes the leaderboard pointless, because some random arrangements are easier than others. You might as well compare PGA tournament scores against mini-golf scores.  In several cases, the random layout has been un-winnable due to a pig randomly being put somewhere where you can not hit him or a structure falls apart by itself because the random materials dont mesh correctly. I actually won a room without flinging a bird because of this.  Of course, they let you buy cheats to get spells to take the skill even further out of the picture, continue the game with additional cards, and buy more lives to keep repeating the levels until you get a good combination of structures, cards, golden bonus birds, etc.  The new bird, Silver, is not too useful for his looping ability. Hes mostly useful as a cleanup bird if you have a pig leftover somewhere.  And the first update adding new levels to a game with random levels was somewhat laughable. Probably a few new layouts and devices, but I havent been interested enough to play up to the new levels yet.  The self-aware pigs sensing when they are about to die are visually interesting, I guess. And an occasional 3D pig splat can be enjoyable, but the freemium gimmicks really take the fun out of this game.  Still playing  angrybirds 2 for now when Im bored and dont have anything else to do, but I doubt Ill keep playing it as much as the other  angrybirds games. The others (except Stella) at least need some skill to win the levels without cheats and they actually feel like you accomplished something when you got 3 stars. Three stars arent that hard to get in  angrybirds 2. Enjoyment is even harder to get out of  angrybirds 2.","rovio has succeeded in doing a masterful job of  ...using every crappy freemium gimmick to milk this franchise beyond the point where its fun any more.  the timed lives are pathetic. a game that actually prevents you from playing it too much. genius! as if the 5 lives was not bad enough, then they changed the max lives you could accumulate to 3! its almost not even worth waiting for the app to open now.  the random levels and materials are the same reason i stopped playing  angrybirds stella: theres no point to winning since its mostly just the luck of the draw on what structures, pig locations, materials, and cards you happen to get.  which also makes the leaderboard pointless, because some random arrangements are easier than others. you might as well compare pga tournament scores against mini-golf scores.  in several cases, the random layout has been un-winnable due to a pig randomly being put somewhere where you can not hit him or a structure falls apart by itself because the random materials dont mesh correctly. i actually won a room without flinging a bird because of this.  of course, they let you buy cheats to get spells to take the skill even further out of the picture, continue the game with additional cards, and buy more lives to keep repeating the levels until you get a good combination of structures, cards, golden bonus birds, etc.  the new bird, silver, is not too useful for his looping ability. hes mostly useful as a cleanup bird if you have a pig leftover somewhere.  and the first update adding new levels to a game with random levels was somewhat laughable. probably a few new layouts and devices, but i havent been interested enough to play up to the new levels yet.  the self-aware pigs sensing when they are about to die are visually interesting, i guess. and an occasional 3d pig splat can be enjoyable, but the freemium gimmicks really take the fun out of this game.  still playing  angrybirds 2 for now when im bored and dont have anything else to do, but i doubt ill keep playing it as much as the other  angrybirds games. the others (except stella) at least need some skill to win the levels without cheats and they actually feel like you accomplished something when you got 3 stars. three stars arent that hard to get in  angrybirds 2. enjoyment is even harder to get out of  angrybirds 2.",2356,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,6,1

US,"Way too hard very quickly for younger players - by level 30, the kids get 5 minutes of repeated losing and then will have to wait for hours or keep paying for another shot (which will likely also last 5 minutes). Earlier games really just required 1 or 2 lucky/well aimed shots, but now you have several phases of needing at least that and so younger players will get stuck.  More experienced angrybirds players might make it farther, but it will get that hard for pretty much all players eventually. The random factor makes some levels just stupid hard - I've had balloon riders + teleporting magicians + multiple shooting pigs in a single level, and if you can not birdie it you will run out before you finish the 5 other levels. I beat the initial 240 levels with only free gem usage, but I have no desire to ever try them again. If you do not get lucky later with the right reinforcements and miss the tricky pigs in bad starting locations, you basically can lose on one phase after 5 phases of perfect play and have to redo them all.

With the introduction of the hearts (more like roadblocks) it's all too clear Rovio is more concerned about making money off their clients then keeping them happy with their product.

CA,"Well, after playing, I realized that Rovio has been going downhill, not uphill, after 2012. 2013 brought the introduction of crossover games, which were a mighty flop. Then came ripoff games like Mario Kart Birds ( angrybirds Go) Medieval Birds ( angrybirds Epic), Stella, Basketball Birds (Seasons) Transformers, Star Wars 2. What was very surprising was that this game did not do the same as other games, but instead the Candy Crush method; horrible life system, 90% need to pay, Facebook, ads, and a weird level style. You also have cards and. Different parts. Which is horrible a bad decision, because you can not really get a tactic, since it changes up each time.

GB,"Ive been an  angrybirds fan since the first game and have played many of the sequels. As you can imagine I was looking forward to playing  angrybirds 2 when it was released and after spending some time with the game there are several things I dont like about it.  Firstly, the in-app purchase model. Im not a fan of in-app purchases and would have preferred if the game was a one off charge of 79p like some of the earlier games have been in the past. I dont mind in-app purchases per se, I was one of the first to pay 69p as an in-app purchase at the time to get unlimited use of the Mighty Eagle in the original game. But things have gone downhill since then and everything is geared towards getting you to spend more on gems, as with many other games sadly. You can still play  angrybirds 2 without spending money as the developer claims but having that option front and centre youre consciously aware of it all the time.  On top of in-app purchases, youre now prompted to watch in-game ads in order to get free extra birds, extra plays in the Arena or to get an extra life, etc. Ive even noticed recently that after completing a level I sometimes get shown a video ad for no apparent reason. I didnt ask for it and it shouldnt be necessary to bombard players with video ads, especially if you havent tapped anything to initiate the video playback in the first place.  Ive also noticed changes in the way many of the birds play. As an example, the blue bird is particularly good at breaking through blue glass objects, but in previous games could also smash wood if need to and if used correctly. In  angrybirds 2 it seems that the blue bird cant even make a dent in wood any more. Similarly, the yellow bird is the king at smashing through wood, but on occasion I would need to use him to smash through glass, which could be done. Now you wouldnt stand a chance, firing Chuck at a glass block will be a waste of bird ammo.  Ive also had issues with the Arena, a part of the game that I play a lot and like the addition of this new feature. I quite often get the number 1 spot enabling me to level up my army of birds. But I have noticed that something strange is happening, I can be at the number 1 spot seconds before the Arena ends and refreshes for the day, then all of a sudden I get awarded feathers to level up and told that I came in 8th place! Whats that all about? Its happened several times, I can be in the top spot by a country mile only to be awarded feathers the second it starts over for the next day and to then be demoted instantly. Today I happened to move from 3rd to 2nd place, which Im not complaining about but I have no idea how that can even happen.  I do like a lot about the game, the fact that you can now choose which bird you use from a possible three is a big help as you progress through the various rooms. As I mentioned the Arena is my favourite feature, pitting you against other players to level up your birds. I also like the different power-ups that you can select at the beginning of a level but again this is something you may eventually have to pay for by forking out for in-game gems to buy them. The graphics, sounds and animations have all improved over the original game and something that makes this game worthwhile playing.  The fact that yet another developer is trying to cram their game full of in-app purchases and video ads just goes to show that they dont care about the customer. Think back to the original  angrybirds, a 69p purchase with no ads, there was originally one in-app purchase giving unlimited use of the Mighty Eagle for those that wanted to gain feathers on every level and that was it. Why couldnt  angrybirds 2 follow that model? Oh sorry, its all about greed, profits and trying to please the people who run the business. Companies in this day and age seem to care very little about their customers rolling out stupid ideas and Im sad to say that this is one of them.","ive been an  angrybirds fan since the first game and have played many of the sequels. as you can imagine i was looking forward to playing  angrybirds 2 when it was released and after spending some time with the game there are several things i dont like about it.  firstly, the in-app purchase model. im not a fan of in-app purchases and would have preferred if the game was a one off charge of 79p like some of the earlier games have been in the past. i dont mind in-app purchases per se, i was one of the first to pay 69p as an in-app purchase at the time to get unlimited use of the mighty eagle in the original game. but things have gone downhill since then and everything is geared towards getting you to spend more on gems, as with many other games sadly. you can still play  angrybirds 2 without spending money as the developer claims but having that option front and centre youre consciously aware of it all the time.  on top of in-app purchases, youre now prompted to watch in-game ads in order to get free extra birds, extra plays in the arena or to get an extra life, etc. ive even noticed recently that after completing a level i sometimes get shown a video ad for no apparent reason. i didnt ask for it and it shouldnt be necessary to bombard players with video ads, especially if you havent tapped anything to initiate the video playback in the first place.  ive also noticed changes in the way many of the birds play. as an example, the blue bird is particularly good at breaking through blue glass objects, but in previous games could also smash wood if need to and if used correctly. in  angrybirds 2 it seems that the blue bird cant even make a dent in wood any more. similarly, the yellow bird is the king at smashing through wood, but on occasion i would need to use him to smash through glass, which could be done. now you wouldnt stand a chance, firing chuck at a glass block will be a waste of bird ammo.  ive also had issues with the arena, a part of the game that i play a lot and like the addition of this new feature. i quite often get the number 1 spot enabling me to level up my army of birds. but i have noticed that something strange is happening, i can be at the number 1 spot seconds before the arena ends and refreshes for the day, then all of a sudden i get awarded feathers to level up and told that i came in 8th place! whats that all about? its happened several times, i can be in the top spot by a country mile only to be awarded feathers the second it starts over for the next day and to then be demoted instantly. today i happened to move from 3rd to 2nd place, which im not complaining about but i have no idea how that can even happen.  i do like a lot about the game, the fact that you can now choose which bird you use from a possible three is a big help as you progress through the various rooms. as i mentioned the arena is my favourite feature, pitting you against other players to level up your birds. i also like the different power-ups that you can select at the beginning of a level but again this is something you may eventually have to pay for by forking out for in-game gems to buy them. the graphics, sounds and animations have all improved over the original game and something that makes this game worthwhile playing.  the fact that yet another developer is trying to cram their game full of in-app purchases and video ads just goes to show that they dont care about the customer. think back to the original  angrybirds, a 69p purchase with no ads, there was originally one in-app purchase giving unlimited use of the mighty eagle for those that wanted to gain feathers on every level and that was it. why couldnt  angrybirds 2 follow that model? oh sorry, its all about greed, profits and trying to please the people who run the business. companies in this day and age seem to care very little about their customers rolling out stupid ideas and im sad to say that this is one of them.",3962,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,1

GB,"For me, this game loses too much of the original magic:  1. You have 5 lives, which you lose when you fail to complete all zones in a given level.  It takes time (or money to skip time) to replenish to allow you to re-attack.  This makes 3 starring much harder on the higher levels as you have to wait an hour for them to replenish.  This means you cannot use this app to whittle away your boredom as youll likely run out of lives in 5 mins on higher levels and be bored again whilst waiting.  2. Due to the constant attempts to force ads down our throats, when on poor network connections it is awful.  Ads to get an extra bird to try and complete a level.  Ads to get extra bonuses.  Ads sporadically for no discernible reason.  For mercy sake, I have heard of all of the apps that are being advertised.  If I wanted them I would have got them.  Advertisers really are wasting their money.  So I thought Id turn off network access?  Nice try, but certain features require network access - like this new league feature.    Pointless Suggestion: Get rid of this lives notion and for goodness sake remove the Ads.  I know you want to make money, so just have a paid for version of the game.   3. Takes forever to login and has had repeated crashes.  They seem to fix them but still intermittent issues.  God help you if you have less than perfect network connection too - you are going to be sitting at splash screens for a long time.  Quite why I need to Log In every time I open the app is beyond me.  Pointless Suggestion: Only use network connection when using network features.  If I want to play a normal level then no network access should be required, and no logging in.  4. For some unknown reason it seems to double fire birds way too frequently.  i.e. pull back bird in the slingshot, let go and time the activation of their ability, and  wait whats the second bird now doing in mid-air????  Guess thats this level failed then :/  Ill give it another go oh wait, Ive run out of lives   Pointless Suggestion: Play your app before releasing?!    No wonder Rovio is laying off staff.  This has taken what could be a great game and turned it into a desperate money grabbing attempt.

GB," angrybirds sticks to some of its roots... SOME, but has also really been defined and tweaked to near perfection; animation is fantastic; the levels are challenging; and the gameplay takes about 3 seconds to pick up.  The new features are also pretty sweet, like the spells and arena. All adds to the game's replay ability.  However, like most people have already said, Rio have really sold out and made a game HEAVY on in app purchases and ads...   This sort of thing would not normally be an issue (for me) but it really grinds my gears that at times it literally stops you from being able to play unless you spend money to buy gems for extra lives. Wanna hit the replay button like old times? Oh no, that's long gone. Say hello to the fancy new \give up\"" button that will cost you a life, which will be replenished in half an hour. Oh, did I also mention that you only get 5 lives anyway?  Well, just in case - you only get 5 lives which will easily be eaten up in a few merciless moments when you hit one of the many tough levels on offer. Rio are still good at this, which is great. Not so great when you're not the best gamer, or a minor that does not have access to a freaking bank account. Or both. I'm neither of these things, but am still having issues.  do not get me wrong, you're not made to stop playing all the time, oh no, you can always watch a nice long add for some second rate crappy game in exchange for a free bird or life. Thanks Rio, for a moment there, I was worried I would not be able to keep going, but thanks to your brilliant ad placement, I can have an extra whack at this tough level, and also be enlightened about Paradise Island or whatever the hell the crappy ad was about.  Seriously, why can not we just pay a fixed, one off payment like old times (I'm sure most  angrybirds fans would not object) and be free to play for however long we want without having more media and advertising crammed down our throats? If Rio did this, but still kept the in app purchases as an option, I'm sure there are still many that would spend their hard earned cash for extra spells and gems.  Great game, but horribly tainted and at times, ruined by the above points I have ranted about.

This new version brings life into the series with fresh animations (if only it was 3D), new boss levels, new birds and new powers, amongst other things.  Unfortunately there is only one drawback; a finite amount of lives. What made  angrybirds so addictive was the ability to play none stop, or without having to wait a long time for a life to return to us. Of course an unlimited option is available but, of course, for a price. Nobody likes to have to do this, and I understand a company needs to make money, but ultimately they will lose on this if they do not invoke a one off price for unlimited fun.
